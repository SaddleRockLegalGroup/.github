    <subject>Hi {!Contact.FirstName}, Important Notice from Saddle Rock Legal Group</subject>
    <textOnly>Date: {!Today()}

Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

We have been unable to reach you about your potential {!litify_pm__Intake__c.Case_Type_Name_del__c} case. We do need to reach you as soon as possible to be able to go through our intake and hopefully file a case for you.

Our intake specialists are still available for a free consultation and are very interested in your {!litify_pm__Intake__c.Case_Type_Name_del__c} case. The consultation will only take 5-10 minutes. Please don&#39;t delay calling as how quickly you reach out to us may be the difference between receiving compensation or not.

Just call us at {!Organization.Phone} between 7 AM and 7 PM EST Monday through Friday or Saturday between 10 AM and 7 PM EST. If we don&#39;t hear from you, we will try you back soon.

Regards,
Saddle Rock Legal Group
