    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

I hope all is well today! This is Saddle Rock Legal Group, the law firm currently working on your {!litify_pm__Intake__c.Case_Type_Name_del__c} case. We have been trying to reach you for some time regarding some missing information on your file. We, unfortunately, will have to reject your claim preventing you from receiving a potential cash settlement if we do not get a response. Call us back at {!Organization.Phone} as soon as possible; it should be a quick 5-10 minute phone call. Thanks!

Regards,
Saddle Rock Legal Group
