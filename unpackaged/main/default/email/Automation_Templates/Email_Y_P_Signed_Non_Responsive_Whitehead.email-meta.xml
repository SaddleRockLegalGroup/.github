    <textOnly>Hi {!Customer.FirstName},

You previously signed our retainer agreement to have a further look at your {!litify_pm__Intake__c.Case_Type_Name_del__c}. Our prosecuting firm has been unable to reach you and it&#39;s crucial you contact them if you want to pursue potentially getting a cash settlement. If you can please reach out to Whitehead Law Firm at
337-740-6006, they need to speak with you to be able to further pursue the case. If they do not hear from you shortly, they will have to reject your case and will not longer be able to help you with a potential settlement.

All the best,
Young &amp; Partners Law
