    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

You previously signed our retainer agreement to have a further look at your {!litify_pm__Intake__c.Case_Type_Name_del__c} case. Our prosecuting firm has been unable to reach you and it&#39;s crucial you contact them if you want to pursue potentially getting a cash settlement. If you can please reach out to our partnering firm, Keller Postman, at (312) 741-5220, they need to speak with you to be able to further pursue the case.

All the best,
Saddle Rock Legal Group
