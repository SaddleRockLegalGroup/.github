<br />
You recently signed an engagement agreement with our firm, Saddle Rock Legal Group, and {{{litify_pm__Intake__c.Referral_Partner_Name__c}}} for your {{{litify_pm__Intake__c.Case_Type_Name_del__c}}} claim.<br />
<br />
We appreciate your interest, but we understand that you were already being represented by us at Saddle Rock Legal Group and our other co-counsel. As such, we are releasing you from {{{litify_pm__Intake__c.Referral_Partner_Name__c}}} for your {{{litify_pm__Intake__c.Case_Type_Name_del__c}}} claim.<br />
<br />
To be clear, Saddle Rock Legal Group still represents you on your {{{litify_pm__Intake__c.Case_Type_Name_del__c}}} case along with our co-counsel so it’s important you don’t sign with any other firm regarding this matter.<br />
<br />
Should you have any questions regarding the progress of your claim, you can reach us at the contact information below.<br />
<br />
We appreciate the opportunity to represent you. You are in great hands with Saddle Rock Legal Group and our legal team.<br />
<br />
Best regards,</span></span><br />
