<body style="height: auto; min-height: auto;">Dear {{{litify_pm__Intake__c.FX_Caller_First_Name__c}}},<br />
<br />
We sent you the e-Sign agreement a little while ago and wanted to make sure you received it...<br />
The quicker we can start working on your legal matter, the better. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you have additional questions, feel free to text us, or you may call us at 888-686-6454 during normal business hours, between 6 AM and 9 PM MST Monday through Friday or Saturday and Sunday between 8 AM and 4:30 PM MST, and we can discuss them. We look forward to hearing from you.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
As a reminder, we do not represent you until you sign a written agreement with us. This is important, as there are statutes of limitation which may forever bar your claim if not filed in a timely manner. As you have not signed our agreement to represent you, we are not yet your lawyers, thus we cannot protect you against this date. &nbsp;Itâ€™s important to sign so we can get to work on your behalf!&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />
<br />
