<br />
Thank you for choosing Saddle Rock Legal Group and our partner firm, Andrews &amp; Thornton, for your Talcum Powder case.<br />
<br />
As we collaborate with Andrews &amp; Thornton on your case, we will provide you with regular updates. We will begin the process of collecting your medical records, and if you happen to have copies or access to them, we kindly ask that you share them with us at&nbsp;<u><a href="mailto:talc@andrewsthornton.com" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">talc@andrewsthornton.com</a></u>. Alternatively, you may prefer to gather your medical records and provide them to us yourself, which we would greatly appreciate. Upon receiving your records, we will conduct a thorough examination of them along with the information you provided during your intake. You can expect to hear from a member of Andrews &amp; Thornton within the next week, and a member of the Saddle Rock client team will remain in touch consistently to ensure that we have the most accurate contact and case information.
